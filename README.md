# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains 2 beginner-friendly Python projects I built while learning Python:

1. **Calculator with History** – A simple calculator that performs +, -, *, / and stores history with options to view or clear it.  
2. **Word Guessing Game** – A guessing game with Easy, Medium, and Hard levels. Shows hints, reveals correct letters, and counts attempts.
